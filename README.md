# [Hotel Management System]

This project is a robust application developed using **Eclipse IDE**, designed with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It features a custom-built Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a persistent data storage system using `.txt` files.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to manage guest reservations.
By leveraging the power of Java, the application provides a modular and scalable solution for **digitizing manual booking processes and ensuring organized data management through a user-friendly interface.** 
It addresses the common problem of data loss and inefficiency in traditional record-keeping by providing a reliable, file-based storage system.
## 🏗️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Features

The software architecture is built on core OOP concepts to ensure clean and maintainable code:

* **Encapsulation:** Sensitive data is protected within classes using private fields and accessed via getter/setter methods.
* **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Used to create reusable class structures and flexible method implementations.
* **Abstraction:** Complex backend logic is abstracted away, providing a simple and intuitive interface for the user.
* **Modularity:** Each GUI component and data handler was implemented as independent modules, integrated step-by-step into the main system.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Manual GUI Integration:** Every window, button, and menu was designed and integrated individually to create a tailored user experience.
* **File-Based Persistence:** Implemented a custom I/O system to read from and write to local `.txt` files, ensuring data is preserved without an external database.
* **Data Validation:** All user inputs received through the GUI are validated before being processed and saved to the text files.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

* **Language:** Java
* **IDE:** Eclipse
* **Data Storage:** Flat File (.txt)
